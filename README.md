## The purpose
I intend to use this for audio visualization with the multi-platform audio player software [amp#](https://github.com/VPKSoft/amp-multi). You may use this as you wish ðŸ™‚

## Setting it up
The software requires [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com) libraries as they are not allowed the be distributed in embeded form. The sample application also contains the libraries.
